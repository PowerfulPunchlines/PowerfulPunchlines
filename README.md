## Current constraints / Some known bugs ##
* YelpFusion API results lag.
* Invited friend must already have a Tripmates account.
* Inviting a nonexistent user prevents trip creation even if an existent user is later invited.
* Creating a trip with the same trip name as someone else's will give you both access to the same trip.
* Adding a date range or activity that matches another exactly will tie vote counts together.
* Estimated costs must be in number format to create trip.
* Adding blank date options/activity ideas displays empty bullets.
* Lonesome lad on homepage banner misrepresents Tripmates' social YOLO ethos.
